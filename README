SWIPE version 2 incorporates a number of new features compared to the initial
release, most notably hit statistics, alignments, as well as support for
nucleotide sequences, large databases and MPI.

The software is distributed from http://github.com/torognes/swipe
Older versions are also available from http://dna.uio.no/swipe/

Binary executables are available for Linux and Mac (both 64-bit).

SWIPE is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.
See the file COPYING for details. SWIPE includes some public domain code for
computing alignment statistics extracted from the BLAST software by the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

  -I, --show_gis             show gi numbers in results (no)
  -p, --symtype=NAME/NUM     symbol type/translation [0-4] (1)
  -S, --strand=NAME/NUM      query strands to search [1-3] (3)
  -Q, --query_gencode=NUM    query genetic code [1-23] (1)
  -D, --db_gencode=NUM       database genetic code [1-23] (1)

  -N, --dump=NUM             dump database [0-2=no,yes,split headers] (0)
  -H, --show_taxid           show taxid etc in results (no)
  -o, --out=FILE             output file (stdout)
  -z, --dbsize=NUM           set effective database size (0)

Defaults are indicated in parentheses in the option list above. NUM means an
integer, while REAL means a floating point number (possibly in scientific
notation). NAME is a string or integer, while FILE is a filename. For databases,
FILE is the base name of the database files.

Most features and options are similar and compatible with NCBI
BLAST.

Please note that SWIPE does not employ composition based statistics (BLAST
option "-C"), but uses the standard Karin-Altschul statistics. Also, sequence
filtering of low complexity regions (BLAST option "-F") is not implemented.
Please pre-filter your query. SWIPE does not use the new sequence length
adjustment statistics (FSC) introduced in BLAST 2.2.26.

The BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62, BLOSUM80, BLOSUM90, PAM30, PAM70 and PAM250
matrices are "built-in". Other matrices may be specified with a file name.

The query and database sequence type is specified with the "-p" option using
either a numeric or text argument according to the table below:

Numeric String  Query  Database Comparisons
0       blastn  NT     NT       Direct + reverse complementary
1       blastp  AA     AA       Direct
2       blastx  NT     AA       Translated query (6 frames)
3       tblastn AA     NT       Translated database (6 frames)
4       tblastx NT     NT       Translated query and database (6x6 frames)

A plain text file with a list of taxid numbers, one per line, may be
specified with the "-x" option to search only sequences from the
specified organisms.

SWIPE accepts only databases prepared using the formatdb or makeblastdb
tools that are distributed together with NCBI BLAST and BLAST+. They
can be downloaded at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/
from NCBI.

The SWIPE distribution includes executable binaries for 64-bit Linux and
Mac. SWIPE may be compiled from sources using either the GNU g++ compiler,
the LLVM Clang compiler or the Intel icpc compiler. SWIPE is marginally
faster when compiled with the Intel compiler than with the GNU compiler.

SWIPE will only run on processors with the SSE2 instruction set and
runs best on processors with the SSSE3 instruction set. Please see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSSE3 for a list of processors with this
instruction set.

The enclosed file scoring.pdf contains a table with the scoring system
parameters that will enable E-value statistics to be computed.

Examples of how to run SWIPE:

To run SWIPE with one or more protein sequence queries in the
FASTA-formatted file named "query.fsa" against the protein
database with base name "swissprot" using 8 threads and an expect
value threshold of 0.001:

./swipe -p 1 -i query.fsa -d swissprot -e 0.001 -a 8

To run SWIPE with a nucleotide sequence query in the file "primer.fsa"
against the nucleotide database file with base name "ecoli" using 1
thread and the default expect value of 10:

./swipe -p 0 -i primer.fsa -d ecoli

To search only the Human entries in the "est" database using a
translated search with the protein query sequence in the file
"prot.fsa":

echo 9606 > human.tax
./swipe -p 3 -i prot.fsa -d est -x human.tax
